- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

Faceting enables to visualize the exact localization of each datapoint that otherwise would have been overmapped. The visualization of data divided into groups is easy to understand only when small datasets are analyzed. In case of larger datasets, the amount of small graphs could be too much to handle. Even though faceting divides data into easily understandable pieses, I still prefer colour aesthetic, because this enables to look at the whole dataset as a whole but still divide data into groups with colour. I believe, that geom_jitter helps better with overmapping, while still providing the big picture. 

- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))
```

###### Plot nr 1
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

###### Plot nr 2
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE)
```

###### Plot nr 3
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

###### Plot nr 4
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

###### Plot nr 5
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```

###### Plot nr 6
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = drv), shape = 21, stroke = 1, color = "white", size = 1)
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

Most of the geoms use stat = "identity". In other cases, the function additive name for geom and stat is similar or the same. 

Within the pair, both functions use the same arguments. 

|geom      |stat     |
|----------|---------|
|area      |identity |
|bar       |count    |
|bin2d     |bin2d    |
|blank     |identity |
|boxplot   |boxplot  |
|col       |count    |
|contour   |contour  |
|count     |sum      |
|crossbar  |identity |
|curve     |identity |
|density   |density  |
|density_2d|density2d|
|errorbar  |identity |
|errorbarh |identity |
|hex       |binhex   |
|freqpoly  |bin      |
|jitter    |identity |
|map       |identity |
|path      |identity |
|line      |identity |
|step      |identity |
|point     |identity |
|polygon   |identity |
|quantile  |quantile |
|ribbon    |identity |
|rug       |identity |
|segmen    |identity |
|smooth    |smooth   |
|spoke     |identity |
|label     |identity |
|text      |identity |
|raster    |identity |
|violin    |identity |
|sf        |sf       |

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

geom_jitter adds a small amount of random variation to the location each point, and is a useful way of handling overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.

geom_count counts the number of observations at each location, then maps the count to point area. It is useful when you have discrete data and overplotting. 

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

This plot shows that city fuel consumption is higher than highway fuel consumption or, in other words, with one gallon of fuel one can drive more miles in highway than in city. 

geom_abline adds a reference line to the plot. coord_fixed is important for a specified ratio between the axes. Both functions help to visualize and evaluate data correctly. 

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?

stat_summary is associated with geom_pointrange. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

geom_bar makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group. It is associated with stat_count. geom_col represent values in the data as heights of the bars. It is associated with stat_identity. In other words, geom_bar calculates the number for the bar while geom_col needs a previously calculated number. 

- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

stat_smooth computes y - predicted value (y ~ x), ymin - lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean, ymax - upper pointwise confidence interval around the mean, and se - standard error. The smoothing curve is controlled by the method argument ("auto", "lm", "glm", "gam", "loess" or a function). 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.3)
```

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```

In the first plot, each cut category proportion is calculated within the cut category group. Adding group = 1 ensures that, when calculating proportions, the overall number of diamonds is taken into account. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

In the second plot, fill = color is getting color from the overall dataset, while it should be pulling the proportions from each cut category. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..count../sum(..count..), fill = color)) +
  ylab("prop")
```
